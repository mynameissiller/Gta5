<h1><Font color="blue">Gta5</font></h1>
<font size="6"><Font color="blue"> Gta5 is a freeroam video game where you can take the roll of three diffrent characters. These charcter are Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Franklin is the one who always has had it hard because he grew up with gangs, and all he wanted to do was make it out
But this all changed one day when his manager at a car auto shop told him to go take a car from some lame daddys boy. He breaks into the home of Michael desanta the one who helps him out to later get a new home from all of the licks they hit on banks store and the federal agency. Michael is the one who with Trevor who was born in Canada and
robbed banks there and became the most wanted men in the world. Michael became weary of this and decided to meet up with a man named Dave and wanted to fake his deathto move to where its warm and where it would be better for his family. One thing he was worried about was how trevor would find out he faked his death which he did and was frusturated to the point 
where he wanted to kill michael but he couldnt for somereason he couldnt. Trevor is a hipster mainiac in the Gta5 series and is a canibalistic murdering freak but his friends (Michael and Franklin) have nothing in common which makes him the oddest one in the group. to sum this is the story of Gta5
